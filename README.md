# Turborepo starter

This is an official Yarn v1 starter turborepo.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `native`: an [Expo](https://expo.dev) app for `ios` and `android` platforms
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `native` applications
- `config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## TODO

Items that are considered TODO's are being tracked in [this project's GitHub Issues using the `enhancement` label](https://github.com/baldyeagle/ten-cookie-cutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) test runner for all things JavaScript
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Setup

Download the Expo cli with the following command:
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Then, download all of the dependencies with this command:
```
yarn
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

If you want to use the mobile app on your phone instead of a simulator, you may want to download the Expo Go app from your phone's app store. The Expo Go app can be opened by scanning a QR code that is generated after running `yarn dev`. I think it's worth doing.

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching (Beta)](https://turborepo.org/docs/features/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching (Beta) you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
